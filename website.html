		<h2>What is Academia?</h2>
		<p>The Latin term “academia” generally refers to a broad-ranging sphere comprised of students, educators, universities, colleges, and everything around and in between them. Essentially, these elements all come together to foster the idea of learning and theoretical endeavors. While academia has been earning praise for its idealistic emphasis on academics, it has garnered more attention even from non-academic individuals for its elegant visuals alone. Over time, it served as an umbrella term for various types of academia-inspired aesthetics.</p>

		<p>In general, any academia aesthetic is characterized by vintage features, especially neoclassical architecture seen among old European universities, museums, art galleries, libraries, etc. Moreover, these motifs tend to focus on liberal arts instead of scientific fields as proven by interests in history, philosophy, sociology, literature, creative arts, and the like. Additionally, with its reliance on education, a few quintessential elements that you wouldn’t miss in any academia motif are books, pens, notes, and study desks. If you are especially fond of mentally stimulating hobbies and believe that “knowledge is power,” the general academia aesthetic may have already won your heart.</p>
